This paper serves as the report for the CQF final project, the theme of which is Deep
Neural Networks for Solving High Dimensional PDEs (DN).

This paper leverages the Deep Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (DeepBSDE)
method to overcome the challenges facing high-dimensional problems. The DeepBSDE
framework reformulates high-dimensional parabolic PDEs as backward stochastic differ-
ential equations, allowing the gradient of the solution to be approximated using neural
networks. Specifically, we apply the DeepBSDE method to solve high-dimensional non-
linear Black-Scholes and HJB equations, demonstrating its efficacy in terms of accuracy
and computational cost.

Our results indicate that the DeepBSDE method provides a scalable and robust approach
for tackling complex high-dimensional PDEs, offering new possibilities for practical ap-
plications in finance and beyond.
